<h1>Advanced Care Research Centre</h1>

<p>I work as a PhD researcher at the <a href = "https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/advanced-care-research-centre">Advanced Care Research Centre</a>, in the University of Edinburgh. The centre focuses on health and social care for older adults, and how policy, data and new technologies can be used to improve the lives of those in later life.</p>

<p>My research looks at how where you live across your life affects your health in old age. It draws on the body of literature that has shown that living in more deprived neighbourhoods is associated with poorer health outcomes, regardless of your own level of deprivation. However, the exact mechanism behind this association is unclear. One potential explanation is the idea that allostatic load - the wear and tear on the body that comes from stresses in your environment - builds up over the course of an individual's life and results in poorer health. I am examining this potential pathway in the context of older adults using longitudinal quantitative models.</p>

<h1>AIM-CISC</h1>

<p>I am a Research Assistant at the University of Edinburgh on AIM-CISC - Artificial Intelligence and Multimorbidity: Clustering in Individuals, Space and Clinical Context. This project is examining patterns in multimorbidity - what combinations of conditions tend to occur in people and how is that influenced by individual-level, geographical and clinical factors?</p>

<p>I work on modelling how social aspects of an individual's neighbourhood might affect the probability of becoming multimorbid, particularly looking at issues such as social cohesion and loneliness.</p>

<h1>Digital Society Project</h1>

<p>I worked at the University of Nottingham, creating and analysing a dataset on the French 2022 parliamentary elections for the Digital Society Project. The dataset collected together Twitter data from all candidates in the election in order to analyse online rhetoric and campaigning practices. Against the backdrop of the success of far-right politicians in France, the data is being used to examine hate speech and nationalist language in political messaging.</p>
